Use this file to record your reflection on this assignment.

- Which methods did you decide to `overload`, and why?
- For the houuse sub classes, I made two overloaded constructors. The first overloaded constructor allows to create a house with only the maximum capacity of its residents while everything else has the super random values. The second constructor allows creating a house with the maximum capacity and the boolean to chek whether the house has a dining room while everything else has default values. 
- For the Library subclass, I made two overloaded constructors, the first one is a default constructor that assigns the super's default variables. The second one allows creating a Library only with the adress of the Library. This is because a library's address could be predefined before they decide on the rest of the details such as its name.
- For the Cafe class, I overloaded the constructor once, alllowing to create a cafe with super's default values and default value of 50 for each of the coffee making materails. This is becauseit would enable to create a cafe with basic stock and information before evrything else such as the name are decided.
- For the cafe class, I also overloaded the sellCoffee method to allow requesting for coffee only. This would help one when they need when they need to order coffee without any additions such as sugar or creams.
- What worked, what didn't, what advice would you give someone taking this course in the future?
- When I tried to commit some changes, the cafe class went wild and started showing errors whose cause I didn't even understand nor could I figure out their cause. I had to restart the repository to make it.
- Like everytime, I think it is good to start ahead of time, so as to save enough time for debugging and fixing any untold mishaps that might occur. It is also helpful to reach out to others to discuss about the assignment to help rectify some confusion that one might have.
